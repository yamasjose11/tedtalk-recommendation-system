# Motivation and Objective

My motivation for this project is woven in my underlying passion for learning and TED Talks never fail to teach me something new. I want to see if i can replicate what most major major streaming services do and that is see if I can explore and build my very own recommender system. With this as my main focus I will try and stick to building a content based recommender using various tool and methods to achieve just that.

# Content-Base Recommender System

*A content-based recommender looks at the characteristics of the users and items to determine what to recommend. For instance, suppose your open a new MovieBinge account and it asks you for your favorite genres. If you say you like Science Fiction and Comedy, it might recommend Galaxy Quest.*
A content-based approach in our case gives recommendations based on the similarity bewteen TED Talk attributes. Content-based recommenders are also very efficient and very easy to interpret and are usually great recommenders for new users. 

# The Data

My data is comprised of two datasets from data.world(link to lower reference part of page) after joining the datasets I have one dataset that contains over 2,500 offical TED Talk Transcripts up to late 2017. This is where the majority of the text-processing of the data will be conducted to make use of a better translating of a recommender.
